# ExtracellularEnzymeActivity-Adventures

Takes raw data from extracellular enzyme plate reads and calculates extracellular enzyme activity.  

This script relies upon consistent naming conventions for your plates! You can pick whatever order you'd like, but you should have these attributes: 
1) Plate reads from each batch should all be stored in 1 excel file, with each plate on different tabs. Different batches should be in different excel files. 
2) The name of each tab should be plot #/name, or Bpl (B plate) 
3) Batch number/name should be in the name of the excel file, in a consistent space such that it can be pulled out by index #

For example, my plates are named 2021_PARCE_EEA_Batch7_EL (Thats YEAR_EXPERIMENT_ASSAY_BATCH_INITIALS)
